# Customer-Segmentation-By-Book-Purchase-History

### Problem Background

**Background:** 
- The previous approach from our client is the "most popular” items recommendation system, based on customers’ purchase history and the purchased items’ relationship with the ecommerce website, that directs users to add items to their shopping carts. This method has successfully increased sales for this website in the past, but we have a better “Recommendation Engine” system that can apply on a broader customer pool (by clustering customers and apply different further approaches to different segments). 

**Data:** 
- Online Book Ecommerce Data.

**Approach:** 
- Our “Recommendation Engine” AI solution for this ecommerce website is to implement the unsupervised clustering(K-Means) method, which creates customer segmentations (by giving different RFM scores, also based on their prior purchases and relationship with the ecommerce website), and evaluated the results (for further actions catering to different customer segments).
